<h2>PHP Exercise - Grammatical Character Count</h2>
<em>This was a code exercise requested for a role.  I did not want the code to go to waste, so I'm releasing it here to assist anyone who might be trying to solve similar issues.</em><br />

<h3>Exercise Goals</h3>
(Quoted from original requirements)
<blockquote>
  <p>
    If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Note:</em> Do not count spaces or hyphens.  For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters.  For this exercise you should use "and" when writing out numbers in compliance with British usage.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    1,2,3,4,5 = 'one' + 'two' + 'three' + 'four' + 'five' = 'onetwothreefourfive' = 19 letters
  </p>
